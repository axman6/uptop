## Quick Start üöÄ

Pre-built (x86_64) binaries for Ubuntu and macOS are available at

https://github.com/ldgrp/uptop/releases

Download the binary, untar the archive and run the `uptop` executable.

```bash
$ tar -xvf uptop-<version>-<os>.tar
$ cd dist
$ ./uptop
```

![auth-tui-screenshot](/img/auth.png)

`uptop` checks the `UP_BANK_TOKEN` environment variable and uses it to populate
the initial auth screen.

### Build from source
If you do not have `cabal`, I highly recommend [`ghcup`][ghcup] or 
reading [this manual][cabal].

```
git clone https://github.com/ldgrp/uptop
cd uptop
cabal install uptop
```
