## Quick Start üöÄ

Pre-built (x86_64) binaries for Ubuntu and macOS are available at

https://github.com/ldgrp/uptop/releases

Download the binary, untar the archive and run the `uptop` executable.

`uptop` will use the `UP_BANK_TOKEN` environment variable to
populate the initial auth screen.

```bash
$ tar -xvf uptop-<version>-<os>.tar
$ cd dist
$ ./uptop
```

If you enconter this error,
```
error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
installing `libncurses5` on Ubuntu solves the problem.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5
```

### Windows

`uptop` depends on `vty` which does **not** support Windows.
Follow the instructions above for WSL.

### Source
If you do not have `cabal`, I highly recommend [`ghcup`][ghcup] or 
reading [this manual][cabal].

```
git clone https://github.com/ldgrp/uptop
cd uptop
cabal install uptop
```
